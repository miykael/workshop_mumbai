    "The goal of this 4h webinar is to get you familiarized with some basic neuroimaging softwares. Keep in mind that the approaches that we show here are adapted to this workshop. We had to cut some corners and leave some analysis steps out, as they otherwise would take too much time. Keep this in mind when you apply the gained knowledge to your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All slides and notebooks of this webinar can found on the [Workshop Mumbai](https://github.com/miykael/workshop_mumbai) github page. For a much more in dept tutorial about [Nipype](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) take a look at the [Nipype Tutorial](https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/). Also, take a look at the [Workshop Cambridge](https://github.com/miykael/workshop_cambridge) github page that covers many of the presented concepts in much more details.\n",

Like this you will have access to any changes of the notebooks or output that you create within this container. For more, take a look at the [Docker information](https://github.com/miykael/workshop_cambridge#docker)."
